# The Barbershop problem
## Introduction
The original barbershop problem was proposed by Dijkstra. A variation of it
appears in Silberschatz and Galvinâ€™s Operating Systems Concepts.


A barbershop consists of a waiting room with n chairs, and the
barber room containing the barber chair. If there are no customers
to be served, the barber goes to sleep. If a customer enters the
barbershop and all chairs are occupied, then the customer leaves
the shop. If the barber is busy, but chairs are available, then the
customer sits in one of the free chairs. If the barber is asleep, the
customer wakes up the barber. Write a program to coordinate the
barber and the customers.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to implement a semaphore from the [little book of semaphores](https://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf) for the school subject R.5.A.10.
